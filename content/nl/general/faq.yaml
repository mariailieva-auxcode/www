    questions:
    - subquestion: Waarom zou ik een zon- of windproject bouwen?
      answer: There are several benefits to using your property you’re not currently using for building a renewable energy project. Firstly, it can provide a steady stream of income for up to 25 years. Most renewable energy developers choose to maintain the renewable energy project on your property at their expense and if you opt for complete unburdening there will be no hassle for you once the system has been built. This way, you can generate money from your otherwise unprofitable land or unused roof space. If you choose to build a solar farm, they don’t emit any pollution or make any noise so there will be no problems for you or your neighbours. In addition, renewable energy projects like these are one of the key steps to fighting climate change and bringing about the energy transition. You can play your part by opting to use your land to help build one. They can help you support your local economy by creating jobs
    - subquestion: Hoe vindt Greenatlas de beste match/projectontwikkelaar voor mij?
      answer: Green Atlas’s unique match-making platform analyses the information you have provided to make sure only project developers that suit your needs are presented. The questions you answered can be linked directly to the characteristics of the developers to find the best match.
    - subquestion: Wat is het verschil tussen gehele en gedeeltelijke ontlasting van een project
      answer: Complete unburdening means the project developer takes care of the entire process for you, including subsidy applications, roof load investigations, engineering & design, financing and installation, maintenance and administration. Partial unburdening allows you as a site owner to engage in the process in some way. Some companies allow you to have autonomy in choosing if you only want help with part of the project. This allows you to use multiple sources to develop the project on your site.
    - subquestion: Hoe berekend Greenatlas hoeveel energie ik produceer?How does Green Atlas calculate how much energy I will produce?
      answer: Green Atlas uses in depth energy modelling to predict the energy yield of your site based on the weather (sun or wind) in your location and how many solar panels or wind turbines can fit on your available site. This can also be used to find the total revenues of the system based on the installation costs, grid connection costs and the money earnt from the SDE+ subsidy once the project is completed.
    - subquestion: Wat is het verdienmodel van Greenatlas?
      answer: Green Atlas’ services are 100% free for all site owners, including the match-making service and our available database. Our income comes from the “finder’s fee” solar developers provide for every new site that is matched through Green Atlas. Because of this, we are constantly working hard for you to make the process as easy as possible.
  - questionName: Wind en zonne-energie projecten
    questions:
    - subquestion: Hoelang duren wind en zonne-energie projecten? 
      answer: Most renewable energy projects last around 25 years. For solar farms, this is usually more, sometimes up to 30 years. For wind turbines, the lifetime is often between 20-25 years.
    - subquestion: Hoe lang duurt het om wind en zonne projecten te bouwen? 
      answer: This depends a lot on the size of the renewable energy project. Larger solar parks usually take between 12-16 weeks to build. However, much of this is legal aspects, such as waiting for the permits, and the final connection to the grid. Physically constructing a solar park can take as little as 3 weeks if everything runs smoothly. For wind turbines however, the physical construction process can take 2 or 3 months. A lot of time is needed to set the foundations of the wind turbine, resulting in a longer construction time.
    - subquestion: Hoeveel zonnepanelen en/of windturbines passen er op mijn land? 
      answer: A good rule of thumb is that approximately 4 solar panels can be installed per 9 m² flat roof. One solar panel is about 1.6m2 but also there needs to be space in between the panels to avoid shading. The orientation of the panel relative to the roof can also affect this number as well. For wind turbines, the answer isn't so much a question of how much area your wind turbine needs but of how far away your wind turbine should be from other obstacles. In this case, it is usually best to install your wind turbine at least 150 meters away from any obstacles nearby, including buildings and trees.
    - subquestion: Hoe subsidieert de overheid hernieuwbare energie?
      answer: The construction of renewable energy projects involves high initial costs. Because of this, the generation of renewable energy is subsidized by the government through the SDE + subsidy. The SDE + subsidy aims that by 2022, 14% of all energy used in the Netherlands will be generated sustainably. In 2018, just 7.4% of its energy came from these sources, significantly below many other countries in Europe. As wind and solar technologies become more efficient and are used on a larger scale, the costs of installing new projects are decreasing. As with other major energy projects, the initial costs are greater than the government can afford. That is why individuals and companies are encouraged to make these investments. However, the government chooses to provide incentives through the netting scheme for small consumers with solar panels and the SDE + subsidy for large solar and wind parks. These schemes ensure that project owners receive a good price for the electricity they generate, reducing the risk for investors and allowing developers to make constant returns. 
    - subquestion: Hoe kan ik mijn eigen geproduceerde energie gebruiken/consumeren? 
      answer: Depending on the size of the renewable energy project, it is possible for you to consume some of the energy you produce before sending it to the grid. This is especially attractive for solar systems built on rooftops. The SDE+ subsidy will even pay you some additional revenue for consuming the electricity yourself if you have a solar system.
    - subquestion: Zijn wind- en zonneprojecten veilig? 
      answer: Without a doubt. All project developers are dedicated to ensuring the project developed on your land obeys all government regulations and standards. Renewable energy technologies are designed to be safe for anyone who interacts with them. There is no need to worry.
    - subquestion: Wat is een  kWp en MWh? 
      answer: kWp is the abbreviation for kilowatt peak (1,000 watt peak). This is the maximum power that a solar panel or a system can produce. MWh is the abbreviation for Mega watt-hour. This is 1,000 x 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh).    
  - questionName: Uw Land
    questions:
    - subquestion: Wat is het meest geschikte land voor zonneparken? 
      answer: The ideal land to build a solar farm is land that can no longer be used for agricultural use. It should also be close to a road, to allow the construction team to reach the land easily, and close to the grid. Building excess cabling and grid connections can add a lot of extra costs to the project and is not attractive to developers.
    - subquestion: Wat is het meest geschikte dak voor zonnepanelen installaties? 
      answer: Most roofs are suitable for building solar parks, as long as it is large enough for the developer’s needs. It should be strong enough to hold a large amount of weight and not be too shaded (for example by other buildings). 
    - subquestion: Wat is het meest geschikte gebied voor windturbines? 
      answer: Luckily, you don’t need an entire field to build a wind turbine. Your land can be used for anything else as long as there is enough space between the wind turbine and any other obstacles. Ideally, the land should be close to a grid connection to minimise additional grid costs.  
    - subquestion: Wat is het verschil tussen leasing en verkopen van mijn land/dak voor hernieuwbare energie?
      answer: When you lease your site, whether this be land or roof, this means you still have ownership of the site but the project developers will take control of the development process. This means you will receive a continuous, annual income from the developer for the use of your land. If you choose to sell your land, however, then the site will no longer be legally yours and it cannot be returned at the end of the project lifetime.
    - subquestion: Hoeveel geld kan ik verdienen door mijn land en/of dak te verhuren? 
      answer: This depends on your location, land in Flevoland is much more expensive than in Groningen for example. 
    - subquestion: Kan ik schade krijgen als ik wind en/of zonne energie installeer op mijn land? 
      answer: Solar panels and wind turbines are very unlikely to cause damage to your site. Once operational, solar farms and wind turbines do not produce or use any hazardous materials or chemicals that could harm your site. During construction, the impacts on the land will be minimal and mostly temporary (aside from the wind turbine foundations). Most impacts here come from the construction equipment and vehicles.    
  - questionName: Werken met projectontwikkelaars 
    questions: 
    - subquestion: Hoe wordt winst gegenereerd voor u en de projectontwikkelaar? 
      answer: 'Most project developers have a long-term vision, allowing them to create a business model that works in the interests of both parties. After all, the relationships between site owners and developers have to last up to 25 years. Site owners therefore receive many benefits: social, financial and promotional.'
    - subquestion: Wat als ik eigenaar wil worden van het energie project?
      answer: Some project developers also up their services for those who want to develop and invest in their own project on their land. This could involve subsidy applications, landscape studies, advice on financing and installation/construction. It is still possible to find these developers through Green Atlas by selecting the ‘partial unburdening’ option.
    - subquestion: Wat als de projectontwikkelaar in financiele problemen komt? 
      answer: This is a very rare occurrence. However, if a developer can’t finish construction then a contract with the developer, usually backed by a major financial institution, will cover the expense of restoring your site to its original state.
    - subquestion: Wie is betrokken tijdens het beheer en uitvoering van het zonne-energie project?
      answer: Solar farms require very little maintenance so there is no need for permanent on-site personnel. Often the project developers will install monitoring systems on your project to allow the maintenance team to monitor it remotely. In addition, a general maintenance check will usually be carried out once a year.
    - subquestion: Wat gebeurd er als de contractduur afgelopen is? 
      answer: When the contract between you and the developer has ended, there are two options. You can extend the contract for another period of time and continue using the services of the developer. Or, you can choose to take over responsibility for the renewable energy system. In both cases, you can still enjoy the full benefits of having renewable energy on your site.
