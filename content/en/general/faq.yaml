    - subquestion: Why should I build solar and/or wind?
      answer: There are several benefits to using your property you’re not currently using for building a renewable energy project. Firstly, it can provide a steady stream of income for up to 25 years. Most renewable energy developers choose to maintain the renewable energy project on your property at their expense and if you opt for complete unburdening there will be no hassle for you once the system has been built. This way, you can generate money from your otherwise unprofitable land or unused roof space. If you choose to build a solar farm, they don’t emit any pollution or make any noise so there will be no problems for you or your neighbours. In addition, renewable energy projects like these are one of the key steps to fighting climate change and bringing about the energy transition. You can play your part by opting to use your land to help build one. They can help you support your local economy by creating jobs
    - subquestion: How does Green Atlas find the best match  for me?
      answer: Green Atlas’s unique match-making platform analyses the information you have provided to make sure only project developers that suit your needs are presented. The questions you answered can be linked directly to the characteristics of the developers to find the best match.
    - subquestion: What is the difference between partial and complete unburdening?
      answer: Complete unburdening means the project developer takes care of the entire process for you, including subsidy applications, roof load investigations, engineering & design, financing and installation, maintenance and administration. Partial unburdening allows you as a site owner to engage in the process in some way. Some companies allow you to have autonomy in choosing if you only want help with part of the project. This allows you to use multiple sources to develop the project on your site.
    - subquestion: How does Green Atlas calculate how much energy I will produce?
      answer: Green Atlas uses in depth energy modelling to predict the energy yield of your site based on the weather (sun or wind) in your location and how many solar panels or wind turbines can fit on your available site. This can also be used to find the total revenues of the system based on the installation costs, grid connection costs and the money earnt from the SDE+ subsidy once the project is completed.
    - subquestion: How does Green Atlas make money?
      answer: Green Atlas’ services are 100% free for all site owners, including the match-making service and our available database. Our income comes from the “finder’s fee” solar developers provide for every new site that is matched through Green Atlas. Because of this, we are constantly working hard for you to make the process as easy as possible.
