    - subquestion: Why should I build solar and/or wind?
      answer: There are several benefits to using your property you’re not currently using for building a renewable energy project. Firstly, it can provide a steady stream of income for up to 25 years. Most renewable energy developers choose to maintain the renewable energy project on your property at their expense and if you opt for complete unburdening there will be no hassle for you once the system has been built. This way, you can generate money from your otherwise unprofitable land or unused roof space. If you choose to build a solar farm, they don’t emit any pollution or make any noise so there will be no problems for you or your neighbours. In addition, renewable energy projects like these are one of the key steps to fighting climate change and bringing about the energy transition. You can play your part by opting to use your land to help build one. They can help you support your local economy by creating jobs
    - subquestion: How does Green Atlas find the best match  for me?
      answer: Green Atlas’s unique match-making platform analyses the information you have provided to make sure only project developers that suit your needs are presented. The questions you answered can be linked directly to the characteristics of the developers to find the best match.
    - subquestion: What is the difference between partial and complete unburdening?
      answer: Complete unburdening means the project developer takes care of the entire process for you, including subsidy applications, roof load investigations, engineering & design, financing and installation, maintenance and administration. Partial unburdening allows you as a site owner to engage in the process in some way. Some companies allow you to have autonomy in choosing if you only want help with part of the project. This allows you to use multiple sources to develop the project on your site.
    - subquestion: How does Green Atlas calculate how much energy I will produce?
      answer: Green Atlas uses in depth energy modelling to predict the energy yield of your site based on the weather (sun or wind) in your location and how many solar panels or wind turbines can fit on your available site. This can also be used to find the total revenues of the system based on the installation costs, grid connection costs and the money earnt from the SDE+ subsidy once the project is completed.
    - subquestion: How does Green Atlas make money?
      answer: Green Atlas’ services are 100% free for all site owners, including the match-making service and our available database. Our income comes from the “finder’s fee” solar developers provide for every new site that is matched through Green Atlas. Because of this, we are constantly working hard for you to make the process as easy as possible.
  - questionName: Renewable energy projects
    questions:
     - subquestion: How long do renewable energy projects last?
       answer: Most renewable energy projects last around 25 years. For solar farms, this is usually more, sometimes up to 30 years. For wind turbines, the lifetime is often between 20-25 years.
     - subquestion: How long does it take to build a renewable energy project?
       answer: This depends a lot on the size of the renewable energy project. Larger solar parks usually take between 12-16 weeks to build. However, much of this is legal aspects, such as waiting for the permits, and the final connection to the grid. Physically constructing a solar park can take as little as 3 weeks if everything runs smoothly. For wind turbines however, the physical construction process can take 2 or 3 months. A lot of time is needed to set the foundations of the wind turbine, resulting in a longer construction time.
     - subquestion: How do you know how many solar panels or wind turbines fit on my land?
       answer: A good rule of thumb is that approximately 4 solar panels can be installed per 9 m² flat roof. One solar panel is about 1.6m2 but also there needs to be space in between the panels to avoid shading. The orientation of the panel relative to the roof can also affect this number as well. For wind turbines, the answer isn't so much a question of how much area your wind turbine needs but of how far away your wind turbine should be from other obstacles. In this case, it is usually best to install your wind turbine at least 150 meters away from any obstacles nearby, including buildings and trees.
     - subquestion: How does the government subsidise renewable energy projects?
       answer: The construction of renewable energy projects involves high initial costs. Because of this, the generation of renewable energy is subsidized by the government through the SDE + subsidy. The SDE + subsidy aims that by 2022, 14% of all energy used in the Netherlands will be generated sustainably. In 2018, just 7.4% of its energy came from these sources, significantly below many other countries in Europe. As wind and solar technologies become more efficient and are used on a larger scale, the costs of installing new projects are decreasing. As with other major energy projects, the initial costs are greater than the government can afford. That is why individuals and companies are encouraged to make these investments. However, the government chooses to provide incentives through the netting scheme for small consumers with solar panels and the SDE + subsidy for large solar and wind parks. These schemes ensure that project owners receive a good price for the electricity they generate, reducing the risk for investors and allowing developers to make constant returns. 
     - subquestion: What if I want to consume some of the energy I produce?
       answer: Depending on the size of the renewable energy project, it is possible for you to consume some of the energy you produce before sending it to the grid. This is especially attractive for solar systems built on rooftops. The SDE+ subsidy will even pay you some additional revenue for consuming the electricity yourself if you have a solar system.
     - subquestion: Are renewable energy projects safe?
       answer: Without a doubt. All project developers are dedicated to ensuring the project developed on your land obeys all government regulations and standards. Renewable energy technologies are designed to be safe for anyone who interacts with them. There is no need to worry.
     - subquestion: What is a kWp and MWh? 
       answer: kWp is the abbreviation for kilowatt peak (1,000 watt peak). This is the maximum power that a solar panel or a system can produce. MWh is the abbreviation for Mega watt-hour. This is 1,000 x 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh).

    questions: 
    - subquestion: How is profit made for both me and the project developer?
      answer: n/a
    - subquestion: What if I want to own the renewable energy project myself?
      answer: Some project developers also up their services for those who want to develop and invest in their own project on their land. This could involve subsidy applications, landscape studies, advice on financing and installation/construction. It is still possible to find these developers through Green Atlas by selecting the ‘partial unburdening’ option.
    - subquestion: What if the solar developer runs into financial problems and can’t finish the project?
