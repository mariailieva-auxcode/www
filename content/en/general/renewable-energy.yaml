  - label: Own, or co-own your own project
    information: You can choose to set up your own renewable energy installation from scratch or partner with a project developer. There are a range of possibilities from complete unburdening by the project developer to active cooperation. You can start a project either in direct partnership with a project developer or as part of a cooperation of site-owners and stakeholders.
  - label: Reduce and mitigate your CO2 footprint
    information: The renewable energy that you produce and consume on your site directly cuts CO2 from the atmosphere. Each Kilowatt hour of clean energy produced reduces the CO2 output of gas and coal.
  - label: Save on your energy bills
    information: As an independent energy prosumer you will save significant money by reducing energy costs and be protected against future price rises. The pay-back time of solar panels on a large rooftop or small wind turbine is typically 5 to 7 years. After that you consume your own free renewable electricity for another 10 to 20 years typically worth tens of thousands of Euros without having to worry about rising energy prices
  - label: Be part of the energy transition
    information: Each new renewable energy project is an integral building block towards reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and protecting our environment against the hazards of climate change. By becoming an independent clean energy producer you are taking a leading role in the energy transition and setting a positive example for your friends, community and network
