title: Our Story
header-text: 
description: Greenatlas.earth was founded in 2020 with the purpose of helping  to create a faster, simpler and more transparent way for people who own or represent locations to find the right partners to set up new renewable energy projects, in the Netherlands and Europe.
	
We believe that giving site-owners and community representatives the right tools and information is critical to the success of a new project. We help empower them to make informed decisions, and take the first steps.

Beyond transparent information setting up a new renewable energy project requires cooperation and trust. Our goal is to help build great partnerships based on trust. Based on inclusive partnerships with multiple stakeholders, guaranteeing the biggest chance of success.

- Providing the market with transparent, reliable, independent information.
- Creating the best matches between site owners, project developers and specialists based on their specific profiles and objectives.
- Digitizing and streamlining complex steps in the project development process.
- Providing tools with which site owners can gain insight into the potential and possibilities of their location in an easy and effective way.
- Our ultimate aim is to empower project initiators (owners, cooperatives etc) to play a more active role in the energy transition and fully benefit from the value potential
