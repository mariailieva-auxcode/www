description: 
  - greenatlas.earth was founded in 2020 with the purpose of helping to create a faster, simpler and more transparent way for people who own or represent locations to find the right partners to set up new renewable energy projects, in the Netherlands and Europe.
  - We believe that giving site-owners and community representatives the right tools and information is critical to the success of a new project. We help empower them to make informed decisions, and take the first steps.
  - Beyond transparent information setting up a new renewable energy project requires cooperation and trust. Our goal is to help build great partnerships based on trust. Based on inclusive partnerships with multiple stakeholders, guaranteeing the biggest chance of success.
